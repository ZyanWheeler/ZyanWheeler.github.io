	<h1>SageMED Internal Pentest</h1>
	<h2>Please read this when you have the time</h2>
    <p>Hello! This is Zyan Wheeler performing a test on the employees at SageMED to see if anyone would fall for a technique called phishing.
	Phishing for those who don’t know is a practice hackers use to pretend to be a reputable company in an attempt to gain access to the target
	companies systems. Typically this is done through emails containing malicious links, much like the one you clicked on.</p>
	<p>Don’t feel too bad though, as phishing and other forms of social engineering are by far the most common and most effective forms of hacking.
	Here is a way to avoid this in the future. If you receive an email from a supposed trusted source that invokes some sort of excitement
	(like your password being stolen or a bill that needs to be paid), it is super important to stay calm and check two things. </p>
	<p>First, carefully check the email address to look for any suspicious spelling or punctuation. The hacker will use an email address that
	looks similar to the company they are trying to imitate. Look out for addresses with periods in places they shouldn’t be and slightly
	misspelled words. If you are ever unsure, check an email you have gotten from the company before to see if it is legit.</p>
	<p>Second is to test the link in the email. When you hover your mouse cursor over a link, it should show a preview of the full unedited link. What hackers do to hide their malicious links is rename them within the email to a link that looks legit. However by hovering over the link, you can reveal its actual name. This unedited link may still be disguised though, check for the same details like with the email address and also check whether it begins with http or https. HTTP is not secure like HTTPS and is not safe. However this does not mean HTTPS is totally safe, just be cautious.  (Below should be an image demonstrating this)
	Thank you for reading all that. By doing so you can help protect SageMED from online threats that could severely damage the business.
	If you are at all curious on how to protect yourself and the business from online threats, here is some additional reading:<p>
